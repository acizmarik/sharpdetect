# Contributing to SharpDetect

There are various ways how you can contribute to SharpDetect. It can be a bug report, feature request, documentation improvement, spreading word about the project and of course, contributing code.
Moreover, you are also encouraged to ask questions when something is not clear.

## Contributing Guidelines

* **NEVER** submit code that is not yours or is incompatible with project's licensing policy.
* **DO NOT** make significant changes, without discussing them first.
* **DO NOT** reorganize members, change line endings, tabs and spaces etc. Unless it is a refactoring PR.
* **DO** try to write idiomatic C#.
* **DO** prioritize existing project's code style.
* **DO** try to add tests when adding a new feature or fixing a bug.

It is appreciated if contributors enable the "Allow edits from maintainers" flag when opening PRs. This can be helpful when a good PR gets abandoned by the original author.
In this case the PR might get finished by the maintainer of the repository.
